# injection-pump
This device injects a specific amount of liquid at a particular speed.
In this project, a liquid injection pump is designed using a syringe, shaft, mechanical components, a stepper motor, an Arduino UNO, and a TFT LCD for user interaction.

Components used in the project:
NEMA 17
A4988
Arduino UNO
Adafruit 2.8 TFT LCD shield with touchscreen
Device operation description:
By setting the injection dose and injection time on the TFT screen, the device automatically injects the specified dose within the set time frame.

The code and Proteus files for this project are available in this repository.
